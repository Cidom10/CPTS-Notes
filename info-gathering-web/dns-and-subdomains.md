# DNS & Subdomains

## DNS

DNS translates human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into the numerical IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to communicate.

### How DNS Works

Steps that DNS takes:

* `Your Computer Asks for Directions (DNS Query)`: When you enter the domain name, your computer first checks its memory (cache) to see if it remembers the IP address from a previous visit. If not, it reaches out to a DNS resolver, usually provided by your internet service provider (ISP).
* `The DNS Resolver Checks its Map (Recursive Lookup)`: The resolver also has a cache, and if it doesn't find the IP address there, it starts a journey through the DNS hierarchy. It begins by asking a root name server, which is like the librarian of the internet.
* `Root Name Server Points the Way`: The root server doesn't know the exact address but knows who does – the Top-Level Domain (TLD) name server responsible for the domain's ending (e.g., .com, .org). It points the resolver in the right direction.
* `TLD Name Server Narrows It Down`: The TLD name server is like a regional map. It knows which authoritative name server is responsible for the specific domain you're looking for (e.g., `example.com`) and sends the resolver there.
* `Authoritative Name Server Delivers the Address`: The authoritative name server is the final stop. It's like the street address of the website you want. It holds the correct IP address and sends it back to the resolver.
* `The DNS Resolver Returns the Information`: The resolver receives the IP address and gives it to your computer. It also remembers it for a while (caches it), in case you want to revisit the website soon.
* `Your Computer Connects`: Now that your computer knows the IP address, it can connect directly to the web server hosting the website, and you can start browsing

### The Hosts File

The `hosts` file is a simple text file used to map hostnames to IP addresses, providing a manual method of domain name resolution that bypasses the DNS process. While DNS automates the translation of domain names to IP addresses, the `hosts` file allows for direct, local overrides. This can be particularly useful for development, troubleshooting, or blocking websites.

The `hosts` file is located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows and in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and MacOS. Each line in the file follows the format:

```txt
<IP Address>    <Hostname> [<Alias> ...]
```

### Key Concepts

In the `Domain Name System` (`DNS`), a `zone` is a distinct part of the domain namespace that a specific entity or administrator manages. Think of it as a virtual container for a set of domain names. For example, `example.com` and all its subdomains (like `mail.example.com` or `blog.example.com`) would typically belong to the same DNS zone.

### DNS Zone Transfers

A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another.

![Diagram showing data transfer between secondary and primary servers. Includes steps: XML Request, XML Record, loop for retries, XML Report, and AOK (Acknowledgment).](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/144/ig_dns_zone_transfers_1.png)

Steps in a DNS zone transfer:

* `Zone Transfer Request (AXFR)`: The secondary DNS server initiates the process by sending a zone transfer request to the primary server. This request typically uses the AXFR (Full Zone Transfer) type.
* `SOA Record Transfer`: Upon receiving the request (and potentially authenticating the secondary server), the primary server responds by sending its Start of Authority (SOA) record. The SOA record contains vital information about the zone, including its serial number, which helps the secondary server determine if its zone data is current.
* `DNS Records Transmission`: The primary server then transfers all the DNS records in the zone to the secondary server, one by one. This includes records like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS, and others that define the domain's subdomains, mail servers, name servers, and other configurations.
* `Zone Transfer Complete`: Once all records have been transmitted, the primary server signals the end of the zone transfer. This notification informs the secondary server that it has received a complete copy of the zone data.
* `Acknowledgement (ACK)`: The secondary server sends an acknowledgement message to the primary server, confirming the successful receipt and processing of the zone data. This completes the zone transfer process.

#### The Vulnerability

Asking a DNS Server for a full copy of their records can reveal a lot of sensitive information

The information gleaned from an unauthorised zone transfer can be invaluable to an attacker. It reveals a comprehensive map of the target's DNS infrastructure, including:

* `Subdomains`: A complete list of subdomains, many of which might not be linked from the main website or easily discoverable through other means. These hidden subdomains could host development servers, staging environments, administrative panels, or other sensitive resources.
* `IP Addresses`: The IP addresses associated with each subdomain, providing potential targets for further reconnaissance or attacks.
* `Name Server Records`: Details about the authoritative name servers for the domain, revealing the hosting provider and potential misconfigurations.

Zone Transfer command:

```bash
dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
```

This command instructs `dig` to request a full zone transfer (`axfr`) from the DNS server responsible for `zonetransfer.me`

## Subdomains

Web Recon on subdomains can help discover:

* `Development and Staging Environments`: Companies often use subdomains to test new features or updates before deploying them to the main site. Due to relaxed security measures, these environments sometimes contain vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information.
* `Hidden Login Portals`: Subdomains might host administrative panels or other login pages that are not meant to be publicly accessible. Attackers seeking unauthorised access can find these as attractive targets.
* `Legacy Applications`: Older, forgotten web applications might reside on subdomains, potentially containing outdated software with known vulnerabilities.
* `Sensitive Information`: Subdomains can inadvertently expose confidential documents, internal data, or configuration files that could be valuable to attackers.

### Subdomain Enumeration

#### Active Enumeration

This involves directly interacting with the target domain's DNS servers to uncover subdomains. One method is attempting a `DNS zone transfer`, where a misconfigured server might inadvertently leak a complete list of subdomains. However, due to tightened security measures, this is rarely successful.

A more common active technique is `brute-force enumeration`, which involves systematically testing a list of potential subdomain names against the target domain. Tools like `dnsenum`, `ffuf`, and `gobuster` can automate this process, using wordlists of common subdomain names or custom-generated lists based on specific patterns.

#### Passive Enumeration

This relies on external sources of information to discover subdomains without directly querying the target's DNS servers. One valuable resource is `Certificate Transparency (CT) logs`, public repositories of SSL/TLS certificates.

Another passive approach involves utilising `search engines` like Google or DuckDuckGo. By employing specialised search operators (e.g., `site:`), you can filter results to show only subdomains related to the target domain.

### Subdomain Bruteforcing

Process of 4 steps:

1. `Wordlist Selection`: The process begins with selecting a wordlist containing potential subdomain names. These wordlists can be:
   * `General-Purpose`: Containing a broad range of common subdomain names (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `blog`, `mail`, `admin`, `test`). This approach is useful when you don't know the target's naming conventions.
   * `Targeted`: Focused on specific industries, technologies, or naming patterns relevant to the target. This approach is more efficient and reduces the chances of false positives.
   * `Custom`: You can create your own wordlist based on specific keywords, patterns, or intelligence gathered from other sources.
2. `Iteration and Querying`: A script or tool iterates through the wordlist, appending each word or phrase to the main domain (e.g., `example.com`) to create potential subdomain names (e.g., `dev.example.com`, `staging.example.com`).
3. `DNS Lookup`: A DNS query is performed for each potential subdomain to check if it resolves to an IP address. This is typically done using the A or AAAA record type.
4. `Filtering and Validation`: If a subdomain resolves successfully, it's added to a list of valid subdomains. Further validation steps might be taken to confirm the subdomain's existence and functionality (e.g., by attempting to access it through a web browser).

`dnsenum` is a versatile and widely-used command-line tool written in Perl. It is a comprehensive toolkit for DNS reconnaissance, providing various functionalities to gather information about a target domain's DNS infrastructure and potential subdomains. The tool offers several key functions:

* `DNS Record Enumeration`: `dnsenum` can retrieve various DNS records, including A, AAAA, NS, MX, and TXT records, providing a comprehensive overview of the target's DNS configuration.
* `Zone Transfer Attempts`: The tool automatically attempts zone transfers from discovered name servers. While most servers are configured to prevent unauthorised zone transfers, a successful attempt can reveal a treasure trove of DNS information.
* `Subdomain Brute-Forcing`: `dnsenum` supports brute-force enumeration of subdomains using a wordlist. This involves systematically testing potential subdomain names against the target domain to identify valid ones.
* `Google Scraping`: The tool can scrape Google search results to find additional subdomains that might not be listed in DNS records directly.
* `Reverse Lookup`: `dnsenum` can perform reverse DNS lookups to identify domains associated with a given IP address, potentially revealing other websites hosted on the same server.
* `WHOIS Lookups`: The tool can also perform WHOIS queries to gather information about domain ownership and registration details.

## Certificate Transparency Logs

`Certificate Transparency` (`CT`) logs are public, append-only ledgers that record the issuance of SSL/TLS certificates. Whenever a Certificate Authority (CA) issues a new certificate, it must submit it to multiple CT logs

Think of CT logs as a `global registry of certificates`. It serves several purposes:

* `Early Detection of Rogue Certificates`
* `Accountability for Certificate Authorities`
* `Strengthening the Web PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)`

Unlike brute-forcing or wordlist-based approaches, which rely on guessing or predicting subdomain names, CT logs provide a definitive record of certificates issued for a domain and its subdomains. This means you're not limited by the scope of your wordlist or the effectiveness of your brute-forcing algorithm. Instead, you gain access to a historical and comprehensive view of a domain's subdomains, including those that might not be actively used or easily guessable.
